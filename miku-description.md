# Miku

## The Editor That Listens

---

## What is Miku?

Miku is a markdown editor with an AI assistant that behaves like a patient, skilled human editor—not a co-writer. 

Unlike conventional AI writing tools that interrupt your flow with real-time suggestions and autocomplete, Miku stays silent while you write and only surfaces feedback after you've finished a thought.

## Philosophy

**"Your words first."**

The writing process belongs to you. AI should enhance your work, not hijack it. Miku never predicts your next word, never interrupts mid-sentence, and never makes you feel like you're competing with a machine for authorship.

Miku is the editor who reads your draft with a pencil, not a pen—marking what *could* change, never forcing what *should*.

## How Miku Works

### Writing Phase — Miku is Silent

While you write, Miku does nothing. No autocomplete. No inline suggestions. No ghost text. No floating menus. Just you and a clean markdown editor.

Write freely. Think out loud. Make mistakes. Miku waits.

### Review Phase — Miku Observes

Once you pause or explicitly request a review, Miku reads your work the way a human editor would. It looks for:

- **Clarity** — Sentences that could be clearer or more direct
- **Flow** — Awkward phrasing or jarring transitions
- **Correctness** — Grammar, spelling, punctuation
- **Economy** — Redundant words or repetitive ideas
- **Tone** — Inconsistencies in voice or register
- **Structure** — Paragraphs or sections that could be reorganized

### Highlight Phase — Miku Marks, Doesn't Change

Miku highlights passages using a color-coded system. Your original text remains completely untouched—Miku simply draws your attention to areas worth revisiting.

Each color represents a category of feedback, making it easy to scan for specific types of suggestions or ignore categories you don't care about.

### Interaction Phase — You Decide

Clicking a highlight opens a small tooltip containing:

- **The observation** — A brief explanation of what Miku noticed
- **A suggested revision** — How Miku might rewrite this passage
- **Your options** — Accept the suggestion, dismiss it, or use it as inspiration to write your own revision

Miku's suggestions are references, not commands. You remain the author.

## What Miku Is Not

**Not an autocomplete engine.** Miku will never try to finish your sentence.

**Not a co-writer.** Miku doesn't generate content for you—it only responds to what you've already written.

**Not intrusive.** There are no popups, no unsolicited suggestions, no "helpful" interruptions.

**Not opinionated about your voice.** Miku identifies potential improvements but respects that you may have intentional stylistic choices.

## Who Miku Is For

- Writers who value ownership of their voice
- People frustrated by aggressive AI "assistance"
- Minimalists who want a distraction-free environment
- Anyone who wants a second pair of eyes—not a ghostwriter

## The Miku Experience

You open Miku. A blank page. You write.

Minutes pass. Pages fill. Miku says nothing.

You finish a section. You lean back. Miku quietly analyzes.

Soft highlights appear—a yellow phrase here, a blue sentence there.

You click one. A small tooltip: *"This sentence is 47 words. Consider breaking it up."* Below, a suggested revision. You read it, take what's useful, write your own version. The highlight disappears.

You keep writing. Miku keeps waiting.

## Summary

Miku is a markdown editor that treats AI as a tool, not a collaborator. It gives you a calm, minimal writing environment and an editor who knows when to stay quiet. Your words come first—always.
